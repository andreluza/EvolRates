# EvolRates

Script with all steps used in the analyses of the paper “Is evolution faster at ecotones? A test using rates and tempo of diet transitions in Neotropical Sigmodontinae (Rodentia, Cricetidae)”, by André Luís Luza, Renan Maestri, Vanderlei Júlio Debastiani, Bruce D. Patterson, Sandra Maria Hartz, and Leandro da Silva Duarte. 

The only data missing here (due to the large file size) are the ecoregions of the World (Olson et al. 2001, Bioscience) and a raster that was used to create points to overlap on ecoregions to obtain ecotone and core points/assemblages (but are available on Zenodo).
